Simple Mode

----------------------------------------
You know, for kids!

Simple Mode does two things: 

	1. disables the Tools menu (if present)
	2. changes the Advanced option to Reset

That's it!

----------------------------------------
Disabling Simple Mode

Delete the following file from your SD card:

	/.userdata/enable-simple-mode
